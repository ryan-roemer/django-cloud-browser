 Screenshots
=============

Here are a few different deployment shots of Cloud Browser in a Django
application. The basic view style and layout is likely to change in the future
when development turns to CSS/JS/HTML enhancements. In the meantime, all styles
are customizable by overriding Cloud Browser CSS classes.

Basic Deployment
================
This is a :ref:`basic installation <install_basic>`, with a view of a
subdirectory with a paged set of files:

Admin Deployment
================
This is the same view and set of containers and files with
:ref:`Django admin integration <install_admin>` for look and feel, and
functionality.

For the admin deployment, the container list can be closed or open (using the
+/- toggle in the upper right hand corner of the container element).
